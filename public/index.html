			<p>Dalston Digital is a very loose group of folk that meet up from time to time to have a beer and talk design and technology, usually in the Dalston/Shoreditch/Islington triangle.</p>
			<p>We are designers, programmers and business people who build the web and want to keep making it better.</p>
			<p>This web page is an effort to increase our exposure and perhaps even foster some between meet up collaborations.</p>

			<h1>#about</h1>
			<p>From what I can gather Dalston Digital Drinks was started by <a href="http://www.alex-and-alex.com/" title="Alex+Alex">Alex+Alex</a> as a way to meet more people doing the same sorts of things as they do and to perhaps meet some freelancers to hire. There was a loose intention that perhaps there might be an informal presentation at the start of the meet up but that didn't ever quite work out.</p>
			<p>Meet ups now take place from time to time organised by whoever takes charge and creates a <a href="http://whenshouldwe.com" title="WhenShouldWe">WhenShouldWe</a> poll.</p>
